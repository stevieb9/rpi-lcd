2.3603  2017-06-25
        - bump prereq of WiringPI::API to 2.3612

        - corrected reference to RPi::WiringPi in the description in POD (closes
          #4)
        - fix unescaped unicode char in POD
        - rename print() to puts(), and print_char() to put_char(), and kept the
          old names as aliases (and updated POD) (closes #1)
        - added check for the return of the file descriptor from WiringPi::API
